# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2026-02-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard in this article: <http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>

We will keep these records in the repository at `docs/architecture/adr`.

## Consequences

- We will see a history of decisions.
- We will know the context of previous decisions.
- We will be able to verify if a decision is still valid.
